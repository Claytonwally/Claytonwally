## Welcome my Portfolio site
 
  The main purpose for this site is to help showcase my talents and abilities as a developer/programmer. The 
platform provided by gitHub is ideal for enabling developers to not only share and showcase their abilities but 
to gain insight from other developers. I've found it to be a great help in learning. 

  I should take a moment and express I'm no expert in any of the technologies or programming languages that I've chosen to
learn or demonstrate on these pages or in any repository on Git. In fact I started all this as a hobby , build a website, just to see if I could do it.  

 
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Claytonwally/my-best-repo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
